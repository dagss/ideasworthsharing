### PATTERN: CAPTURE ALL RELEVANT PERFORMANCE METRICS ###

## Rationale
Applications typically consist of multiple services and service instances that are running on multiple machines. Requests often span multiple service instances. Each service handles a request by performing one or more operations, e.g. database queries, publishes messages, invoke external APIs etc. It should be possible to estimate the health of a system by understanding the behavior of the individual service.

## Solution
Instrument a service to gather statistics about individual operations. Aggregate metrics in centralized metrics service, which provides reporting and alerting.
Metrics can be collected and reported in following ways:
*	Metrics collected by native tools such as AWS CloudWatch or Azure Monitor that can collect metrics related to applications, infra and network
*	Application Metrics collected by commercial APM tools such as Datadog, New Relic or open-source tools such as Prometheus+Grafana. The metrics are collected via agents with no changes required in application - e.g. AWS metrics (EC2, RDS etc.), Application & Api service response times etc.
*	For applications deployed in container clusters, using service mesh such as Istio will allow collecting traffic metrics leveraging Prometheus+Grafana
*	Metrics collected and logged in application / system logs aggregated in ELK/TICK e.g. response times from 3rd party systems, Errors types with count etc. These can then be displayed in dashboards for easy monitoring and thresholds / alerts configured as required

A combination of above methods should be used for complete end to end monitoring
