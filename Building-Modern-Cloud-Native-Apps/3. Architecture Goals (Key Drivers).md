### Architecture Goals (What are the Key Drivers?) ###

Following are some of the key architecture principles and goals that form the context in which the cloud native architectures need to be applied:

## Architectural goal - Highly robust platform
* Failure aware – Architecture should be resilient to occasional or extended failures of underlying infrastructure components or dependent services
* Limit impact of failures – The architecture should protect against cascading failures
* Graceful degradation – The architecture should ensure graceful degradation of services
* Ensure business continuity - The architecture should ensure platform availability in disaster scenario

## Architectural goal - Scale with business demand / Flexibility
*	Use platform auto-scaling – The architecture should leverage platform auto-scaling features wherever possible
*	API driven – Services should be composable by exposing APIs which align with company API guidelines
*	Loose coupling – All layers shall be loosely coupled and cater for reuse of services

## Architectural goal - Time to market
*	Control Technical diversity – Basic technology needs shall be standardized and available to underpin functional needs.
*	Cloud native – Use platform cloud-native services wherever possible
*	Automation – Automate critical parts of value stream e.g. automated testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery
*	Channel agnostic – Services, except for frontend layer, shall be channel agnostic
*	Autonomy – The platform should cater for a high degree of autonomy for new business applications

## Architectural goal - Operational Excellence
*	Instrumented – Sufficient telemetry data should be made available from applications to determine operational health
*	End to end insight – The platform should enable end to end monitoring and insight into the run-time environment
*	Service governance – The platform should have strong capabilities to manage and govern services, internally and externally
*	Dependency governance – Dependencies horizontally shall be very strictly governed and explicit guidance on where and how this is allowed is to be provided

## Architectural goal – Security
*	Secure – Architecture must be designed to prevent malicious activity, guard against accidental events and restrict access to authenticated users.
