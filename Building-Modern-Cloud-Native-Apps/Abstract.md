## Abtract

The intent of this guide is to serve as a handbook for architects who are in process of either migrating “traditionally” built applications to a cloud platform (either on premise, private or public cloud) or embarking on a journey to build new applications from scratch that must exhibit capabilities of reliability, scalability and ability to change to support business aspirations. 

While an architect now has a big suite of ready-to-use cloud services to pick and choose from, it is difficult to understand the tradeoffs and handoffs between what cloud platforms will handle and what the application is expected to handle. Having an understanding of the core cloud native implementation patterns can give a good starting point for gauging the capabilities needed in choosing the right technology stack.
