### PATTERN: VISUALIZE DEPENDENCY GRAPH ###

## Rationale
A reasonably complex system will have potentially hundreds of services deployed that will need to collaborate to provide a user experience. At scale, it is difficult to manage it and also to understand the behaviour of the system as a whole. In addition, there is a need for teams to understand the impact of their actions taken within their domain on other domains.

## Solution
Create a visual model that helps teams to answer following questions:
*	Which resources are exposed by what services?
*	What services are impacted when a component has to change?
*	How to view an end-to-end trace for a front end request?
*	Which version of components is deployed?
*	How to document dependencies?

AWS X-Ray and Azure Application Insights provide a native approach to visualizing service graphs

For applications deployed in container clusters, using service mesh such as Istio will allow visualizing graphs using health monitoring solution called kiali. (https://www.kiali.io/documentation/distributed-tracing/ )
