### PATTERN: VISUALIZE DISTRIBUTED TRACING ###

## Rationale
External monitoring only gives the overall response time and number of invocations , itâ€™s difficult to get insight into the individual operations

## Solution
Use a unique id that can be used to trace every request
Instrument services with code that:
*	Assign each external request a unique external request id
*	Pass the external request id to all services that are involved in handling the request
*	Include the external request id in all log messages
*	Record information (e.g. start time, end time) about the requests and operations performed when handling an external request in a centralized service

There are following approaches to implement the solution:
*	AWS X-ray and Azure Application Insights & Monitor provides a native approach 
*	Spring Cloud Sleuth instruments Spring components to gather trace information and can deliver it to a Zipkin Server, which gathers and displays traces
*	Jaeger is similar to Zipkin and can be used with Istio, integrating application traces with Envoy (service proxy) on k8s.
