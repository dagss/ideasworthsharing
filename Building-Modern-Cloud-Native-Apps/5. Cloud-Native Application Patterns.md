### Cloud-Native Application Patterns ###

This section lists the set of design patterns that enable applications to fully utilize the agility, scalability, resiliency, elasticity and economies of scale benefits provided by cloud computing. This is also called the Cloud native architecture. The patterns described are suitable for micro- services style architecture where multiple self-contained, autonomous services need to collaborate in real-time to implement some business capability. While the patterns at a high level can be categorized into Infrastructure, Data and Application with security being a cross-concern, in this first installment, we will focus on the Application patterns. 

Since the application pattern catalog is quite vast, to further filter within these, I have selected the following patterns that are especially critical in the cloud context and that have significant cloud native offerings for further exploration:
