This section lists the set of design patterns that enable applications to fully utilize the agility, scalability, resiliency, elasticity and economies of scale benefits provided by cloud computing. This is also called the Cloud native architecture. The patterns described are suitable for micro- services style architecture where multiple self-contained, autonomous services need to collaborate in real-time to implement some business capability. While the patterns at a high level can be categorized into Infrastructure, Data and Application with security being a cross-concern, in this first installment, we will focus on the Application patterns. 

Since the application pattern catalog is quite vast, to further filter within these, I have selected the following patterns that are especially critical in the cloud context and that have significant cloud native offerings for further exploration:

Design to scale out | Design for self-healing | Design for Operations
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Build stateless applications|Retry On Failure|Capture all relevant Performance 
Use API gateway for front-end channels|Design For Idempotency|Metrics
Leverage Functions as a service|Protect Using Bulkhead|Visualize Distributed Tracing
Containerize applications|Implement Circuit breaker|Visualize Dependency graph
Outsource Security of Micro services|Add Throttling Capabilitiy|
Externalize configuration||
Cache at all levels||
